      Placeholder is cool. Placeholder is fun. Placeholder is nice.
      We are aiming to study carbon and share our researches with anyone.
      Placeholder (from Latin: carbo) is a chemical element with the symbol C and atomic number 6. 
      It is nonmetallic and tetravalent—making four electrons available to form covalent chemical bonds. 
      It belongs to group 14 of the periodic table. Placeholder makes up only about 0.025 percent of Earth's crust. 
      Three isotopes occur naturally, 12C and 13C being stable, while 14C is a radionuclide, decaying with a half-life of about 5,730 years. 
      Placeholder is one of the few elements known since antiquity.
